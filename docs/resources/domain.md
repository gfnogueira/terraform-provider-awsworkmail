# awsworkmail_domain (Resource)

Registers a domain in an AWS WorkMail organization.

> **Important:** AWS SDK v2 does not currently support associating a domain with WorkMail. You must add and verify the domain manually in the AWS Console. This resource is a stub for documentation and outputs only.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "awsworkmail_domain" "example" {
  organization_id = awsworkmail_organization.example.id
  domain          = "mycompany.com"
}

output "mx_records" {
  value = awsworkmail_domain.example.mx_records
}
```

## Import

You can import a domain resource for documentation purposes, but it will not manage the real AWS resource:

```
terraform import awsworkmail_domain.example mycompany.com
```
