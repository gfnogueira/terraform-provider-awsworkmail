# awsworkmail_domain (Resource)

Registers and manages a domain in an AWS WorkMail organization. This resource handles the complete lifecycle of WorkMail domains including registration, management, and cleanup.

## Features

- Registers domains with AWS WorkMail
- Retrieves MX records for DNS configuration
- Supports domain import for existing domains
- Handles domain deregistration on resource deletion

## Example Usage

### Basic Domain Registration

```hcl
resource "awsworkmail_organization" "example" {
  alias = "my-workmail-org"
}

resource "awsworkmail_domain" "example" {
  organization_id = awsworkmail_organization.example.id
  domain          = "mycompany.com"
}

# Output MX records for DNS configuration
output "mx_records" {
  description = "MX records to configure in your DNS provider"
  value       = awsworkmail_domain.example.mx_records
}
```

### Complete Setup with DNS Records

```hcl
# WorkMail domain registration
resource "awsworkmail_domain" "company" {
  organization_id = awsworkmail_organization.main.id
  domain          = "company.com"
}

# Example Route53 MX record configuration (if using Route53)
resource "aws_route53_record" "mx" {
  zone_id = aws_route53_zone.company.zone_id
  name    = "company.com"
  type    = "MX"
  ttl     = 300
  records = awsworkmail_domain.company.mx_records
}
```

## Import

You can import a domain resource by providing both the Organization ID and the domain name, separated by a comma:

```
terraform import awsworkmail_domain.example organization_id,domain_name
```

Example:
```
terraform import awsworkmail_domain.example m-12345678901234567890123456789012,mycompany.com
```
