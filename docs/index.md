# awsworkmail Provider

The `awsworkmail` provider enables you to manage [AWS WorkMail](https://aws.amazon.com/workmail/) resources using Terraform. You can automate the creation and management of organizations, users, and groups, and document domain configuration.

## Features

- Create, update, and delete AWS WorkMail organizations
- Manage users and groups within organizations
- Import existing organizations, users, and groups
- Document domain configuration (stub resource, see limitations)

## Supported Resources

- [`awsworkmail_organization`](./resources/organization.md): Manage WorkMail organizations
- [`awsworkmail_user`](./resources/user.md): Manage users in a WorkMail organization
- [`awsworkmail_group`](./resources/group.md): Manage groups in a WorkMail organization
- [`awsworkmail_domain`](./resources/domain.md): Document domain configuration (stub, manual step required)

## Data Sources

- _No data sources are currently available._

## Example Usage

```hcl
provider "awsworkmail" {}

resource "awsworkmail_organization" "example" {
  alias = "my-workmail-org"
}

resource "awsworkmail_user" "example" {
  organization_id = awsworkmail_organization.example.id
  name           = "john.doe"
  display_name   = "John Doe"
  password       = "ChangeMe123!"
  email          = "john.doe@mycompany.com"
}

resource "awsworkmail_group" "example" {
  organization_id = awsworkmail_organization.example.id
  name           = "dev-team"
  members        = [awsworkmail_user.example.id]
}

# Domain resource is a stub for documentation only
resource "awsworkmail_domain" "example" {
  organization_id = awsworkmail_organization.example.id
  domain          = "mycompany.com"
}
```

## Import

You can import existing resources using the following commands:

- Organization:
  ```
  terraform import awsworkmail_organization.example m-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  ```
- User:
  ```
  terraform import awsworkmail_user.example <user-id>
  ```
- Group:
  ```
  terraform import awsworkmail_group.example <group-id>
  ```
- Domain (stub, for documentation only):
  ```
  terraform import awsworkmail_domain.example mycompany.com
  ```

## Limitations

- The `awsworkmail_domain` resource is a stub for documentation. AWS SDK v2 does not support domain registration; you must add and verify domains manually in the AWS Console.
- No data sources are currently available.

## Important Note on Group Creation

> **Note:** To create groups in AWS WorkMail using this provider, your domain must already be added and verified in your WorkMail organization via the AWS Console. Group creation will fail if the domain is not present and active. This is a limitation of the AWS WorkMail API and cannot be automated by Terraform at this time.
