  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "awsworkmail_organization" "example" {
  alias = "my-workmail-org"
}

# Register domain and get MX records
resource "awsworkmail_domain" "example" {
  organization_id = awsworkmail_organization.example.id
  domain          = "mycompany.com"
}

# Create users
resource "awsworkmail_user" "john" {
  organization_id = awsworkmail_organization.example.id
